# Personal-WireGuard-VPN-Setup
This project outlines how I set up my own WireGuard VPN server to enhance my online security and privacy. Using Oracle Cloud's Always Free Tier, I created a secure and private VPN environment while also gaining a deeper understanding of how VPNs work. This document reflects my journey, the challenges I faced, and how I tackled each step.
